## Description
For this task the developer should create a scene which will have both of the sprites provided, rig the body sprite with bones, and attach a rigidbody to the ball sprite. The aim of this task is to achieve a scene where both the ball, and the body should be grabbable, and can be moved around in the scene. The body when picked around, should react to motion(like flailing arms in the opposite direction of the motion).The ball doesn't have to change it's form relative to the velocity, but it's extra points if it does. If the player picks up the ball and throws it at the body, the body should be affected by the collision but come back to it's initial position afterwards(kinda like a one way spring, which will bring the limbs to the original position).
